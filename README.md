# data-storytelling
🎯 OVERVIEW: Complex -> Simple
This agent transforms YouTube video transcripts into compelling social media posts using data storytelling principles. It's built on the foundation that data alone doesn't change minds—stories do.
Core Philosophy
DATA (reliable sources) + STORY (narrative structure) + AUDIENCE (relevance) = IMPACT

A Gemini-powered agent that creates compelling social media posts using 
data storytelling principles from Matthew Dicks, Michael Lewis, and other experts.

Core Principles:
1. RELIABLE DATA: Every claim backed by transcript or verified web sources
2. STORY STRUCTURE: Beginning (hook) → Middle (context) → End (revelation)
3. AUDIENCE FOCUS: Tailored for 20s-30s professionals
4. REVELATION: Clear "Aha!" moment
5. CONSEQUENCES: Stakes, "So What?", real impact on audience

📚 STORYTELLING PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTED
1. THE THREE-ACT STRUCTURE (Matthew Dicks Framework)
Based on Matthew Dicks' approach to storytelling, every post follows:
BEGINNING (Hook)

Grabs attention immediately
Often starts with a moment, not an explanation
Creates curiosity or emotional connection
Example: "I used to think data spoke for itself. I was wrong."

MIDDLE (Context + Development)

Sets up the situation or problem
Provides necessary background
Builds tension or establishes stakes
Example: "Picture this: executives drowning in reports, missing the insights..."

END (Revelation + Consequences)

The "Aha!" moment - the insight that changes perspective
The "So What?" - why it matters
Clear stakes and real-world impact
Example: "Here's what the data reveals: [insight]. This means [specific impact on your career]..."

2. DATA RELIABILITY (Evidence-Based Storytelling)
Inspired by Michael Lewis's journalistic rigor:

Every claim must be verifiable from the transcript or reliable web sources
Data sources tracked for each post
Reliability scoring (0-1 scale) for each claim
Transparent attribution - readers know where information comes from

3. AUDIENCE-FIRST APPROACH
Everything is tailored for professionals in their 20s-30s because:

They're building careers and need actionable insights
They value authenticity over corporate speak
They want to understand trends before they're mainstream
They care about practical application

For each post, the agent considers:

Career growth implications
Skills development opportunities
Industry trends that matter now
Practical steps they can take

4. THE REVELATION (The "Aha!" Moment)
Every story needs a moment where perspective shifts:

What people think vs. what the data shows
Common assumptions vs. surprising reality
The hidden pattern that changes everything

Example revelations:
"The best opportunities aren't in having more data—they're in finding the right story"

5. CONSEQUENCES (The "So What?" Factor)
Leonard Mlodinow's approach to making science matter—show real stakes:

Personal impact: How does this affect YOUR career?
Professional consequences: What happens if you ignore this?
Opportunity cost: What are you missing?
Tangible benefits: What can you gain?
